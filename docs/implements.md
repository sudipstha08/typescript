## Implements

- In Typescript an implements clause can be used to verify that a class conforms to a specific interface. If a class fails to implement an interface correctly, an error will be generated. Classes can implement a single interface or multiple interfaces at once.
- Implements is used in a class to indicate that the class is going to implement a particular interface. It ensures that the class includes all the properties and methods specified by the interface.
- Promotes code reusability and abstraction through interfaces.


## extends
- The new class is a child. It gets benefits coming with inheritance. It has all the properties and methods of its parent. It can override some of these and implement new ones, but the parent stuff is already included.
- extends is used to create a subclass that inherits properties and methods from another class or to extend a type by including properties from another type.
- Promotes code reusability
